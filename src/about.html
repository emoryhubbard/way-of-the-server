      <p class="tutorial__p">Why make the <a class="tutorial__p__a" href="/the-way.html">Way of the Server</a> tutorial?</p>
            <p class="tutorial__p">The two hardest programming challenges I ever faced, were (1) setting up a local PHP development environment, and (2) actually deploying live sites. This web app will be a tutorial site that covers how to do this. I'm going to cover (1) JUST enough so that the reader can be prepared for (2).</p>

            <p class="tutorial__p">The goal is to deploy a static web app with a self-hosted back-end, and document my progress. It will include a comment system, database, and user authentication. The final product will be tutorial that users can comment on, and add their own perspectives and advice on this difficult process.</p>
