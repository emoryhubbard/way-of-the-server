# The Way of the Server

This site was created in as a tutorial to help people learn how to host their static sites, and self-host their own back-end APIs that they make to power them.

This site is not currently deployed or hosted, but you can run it locally, and if you just want to quickly see the tutorial it can be read in the source here: https://github.com/emoryhubbard/way-of-the-server/blob/main/src/public/templates/tutorial.html

## Starting Configuration

Starting configuration for this site was based on the sleepoutside project, which was used as a template: https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside

The HTML, CSS, and JS source files themselves are new.
